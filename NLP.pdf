NLP E2E Project Explantions â€“ Word 2 Vec
1. Problem Definition
Define the goal of the project, which in this case is sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis
involves determining the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of a given text.
2. Data Collection
Gather a dataset containing text samples along with their corresponding sentiment labels.
Common datasets for sentiment analysis include movie reviews, product reviews, social media
comments, etc.
3. Data Preprocessing
- Clean the text data by removing noise such as special characters, punctuation, and irrelevant
information.
- Tokenize the text into words or phrases.
- Remove stopwords (common words like 'and', 'the', 'is') that do not carry significant meaning.
- Optionally, perform stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their root form.
4. Word Embedding
- Train a Word2Vec model on your preprocessed text data. Word2Vec is a popular technique for
generating word embeddings, which are dense vector representations of words in a continuous
vector space.
- Alternatively, you can use pre-trained Word2Vec embeddings available in libraries like Gensim
or spaCy.
5. Feature Extraction
- Convert each text sample into a fixed-length vector representation using the Word2Vec
embeddings.
- This can be done by averaging the embeddings of individual words in the text or by
concatenating them into a single vector.
6. Model Building
- Choose a machine learning or deep learning model for sentiment analysis. Common choices
include logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), or
convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
- Train the chosen model on the feature vectors obtained from the previous step, along with their
corresponding sentiment labels.
7. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy,
precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
- Use techniques like cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and generalization ability.
8. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Fine-tune the model hyperparameters to improve its performance.
- This can involve adjusting parameters like learning rate, regularization strength, dropout rate,
etc.
9. Deployment
- Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it into production.
- This could involve integrating the model into a web application, API, or any other relevant
platform where it can be used to analyze the sentiment of new text inputs.10. Monitoring and Maintenance
- Continuously monitor the model's performance in production and retrain/update it as needed.
- Keep track of any concept drift or changes in data distribution that may affect the model's
performance over time.
